"Have patience. All things are difficult before they are easy."

## First Post
So I just made a blog using Github Pages and Jekyll. This was my first time using Github, but I think I've gotten the gist of it. As a somewhat newcomer, I did face some challenges. Understanding the purpose of most files was one puzzle I had to solve. The `_config.yml` file, for example, played a crucial role in configuring my entire site. It took some trial and error to get everything just right, but it was rewarding when I saw my changes come to life on the site. Watching tutorials, reading documentation, and seeking help from the web really does help. 

There were moments of frustration with the CSS code, but the feeling of satisfaction when I finally brought an idea to life was unparalleled. Honestly, that's why coding is so cool. I am definitely happy with the end product, but I think it would be cool to add a comments section or a gallery page to share my work. We'll see. Hopefully the time spent making this site proves to be worth it.

My key takeaway from working with Jekyll is that it's a powerful and flexible static site generator that streamlines the process of building and maintaining a blog or website. It is so easy to make a new post. While there were some initial challenges in understanding the file structure and configuration, the learning curve was well worth it. Jekyll's simplicity and the ability to write content in Markdown made it an ideal choice for my blog. 

## Summer So Far
Summer has been fun yet productive. I am usually out volunteering at places, hanging with friends, or studying. I have also gotten the chance to focus more on fencing and art. One of the cool things I got to work on this summer was an experiment for Cubes in Space. It contained a report about the effects space radiation would potentially have on a RF transceiver and light sensor. Out of hundreds of teams internationally, my team was one of the few who got selected. That means our experiment will actually go into space! 

Speaking of space, I had a once-in-a-lifetime encounter with greatness when I met Apollo astronaut Fred Haise in person! The moment was absolutely surreal, and hearing his incredible stories ignited a spark of inspiration within me. It's a memory I'll cherish forever and a reminder of the vast possibilities that lie beyond our planet.

Moving on from space, I got to go to Louisville, Kentucky for a national data science competition. It was so nice meeting passionate and driven people from all across the country. Though I got 7th place, the experience was invaluable, and I'm already planning to crush it next year armed with newfound knowledge and determination. 

The picture you see above was actually from a leadership camp I attended a couple weeks ago. I was a bit hesitant to go, but I am so glad I did. I got to make so many memories and inside jokes like debating duo character one (it's a long story) So much more has happened this summer, but that's a story for another day.

As the summer days draw to a close, I can't help but look back. I don't want summer to end, but I might as well enjoy these last weeks.
## Future Plans
I would like to post blogs on STEM topics like data science or machine learning, considering the classes I am taking.

But hey, let's talk about the real deal â€” junior year. It comes with its fair share of pressure, demanding AP courses and tests galore. I'm pretty sure I'll be at the peak of extracurriculars this year. As I navigate through this critical year, I'll be sharing my experiences, challenges, and how I overcome them. I've got some friends at my school who put in some serious work, and I hope to channel that determination too, without the external forces nudging me along.

Here's a mantra I'll carry with me: True growth comes from self-driven change, not from external pressures. So, while I face challenges and keep pushing forward, I'll always remember that every hurdle is an opportunity to become a skilled sailor, just like the wise words from Franklin D. Roosevelt. Success and accomplishments are not products of luck alone but require consistent perseverance, effort, and focus. 

But yeah, that's all I have for today. Have a great evening!
